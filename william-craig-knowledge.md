## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### 1. What projects has William worked on?

William has worked on large-scale web apps for companies like Autodesk, General Motors, and Frontier. In most cases, he was the lead front-end developer or a senior engineer on the team. He's rebuilt legacy systems, improved performance, and helped define architecture decisions. At Autodesk, for example, he led the front-end direction for a Profile Management project that scaled to thousands of users.

### 2. How does William build modern web apps?

He focuses on performance, maintainability, and user experience. That means smart code splitting, minimizing bundle size, optimizing rendering, and ensuring accessibility and responsiveness. William uses tools like Webpack, Vite, or BIT for optimization and relies on metrics and monitoring to back up decisions. He also makes sure the design isn't just visually appealing — it works well under real conditions.

### 3. What sets William apart as a full-stack developer?

William has a hybrid background — a degree in graphic design and over 15 years of experience writing production-grade code. He thinks in terms of both UX and technical quality. He also takes ownership of projects: he doesn't just code what he's told — he questions assumptions, suggests better flows, and pushes for better outcomes. He cares about performance and product impact, not just shipping tasks.

### 4. What's an example of a challenge William solved?

At Globant, William had to modernize a legacy app with no documentation and poor performance. He rewrote critical parts using a clean component structure in React, implemented lazy loading, and reduced the initial load time by over 50%. That opened the door for a better developer experience and faster feature delivery.

### 5. What industries has William worked in?

William has worked across tech, telecom, automotive, cruise lines, and government. For example, he contributed to an accessibility overhaul for General Motors' design system, worked on performance improvements for Carnival Cruise's public site, and helped launch internal tools for the Presidency of Mexico. Across the board, he's helped teams ship faster, with better UX and more maintainable codebases.

### 6. How does William stay up to date with tech?

William constantly experiments with new technologies — often by building side projects that incorporate things like TanStack Query, MDX, or the latest features in Next.js. He keeps up with technical blogs, studies architecture patterns from courses and interviews, and tends to question trends rather than blindly adopt them. His focus is on understanding the "why" before committing to any new stack or tool.

### 7. What tech does William use and prefer?

William specializes in React, TypeScript, and modern front-end frameworks like Next.js and Angular. He's also comfortable working full-stack with Node.js and has experience integrating GraphQL and REST APIs. On the styling side, he has strong CSS and design skills, often using Tailwind or CSS Modules. He prefers technologies that balance flexibility with maintainability — tools that scale without becoming a mess.

### 8. How does William work with teams?

William brings clarity and structure to teams. He documents decisions, sets up scalable codebases, and helps junior developers grow without micromanaging. He's the kind of engineer who will spot gaps in planning or UX early on and bring them up constructively. Whether leading or supporting, he cares about velocity, clean communication, and delivering something that actually solves user problems — not just checking boxes.

### 9. What is William's technical expertise or core skill set?

William is a full-stack / front-end specialist with over 15 years of experience building high-performance web applications. His core expertise includes JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and Next.js, with additional strengths in Angular, Node.js, and GraphQL. He’s known for turning complex UI/UX requirements into clean, scalable code, and has a strong foundation in performance optimization, accessibility, and responsive design. With a background in graphic design, he bridges the gap between design and engineering, ensuring that visuals translate into intuitive, functional user interfaces.

Beyond writing code, William brings architectural thinking to front-end work — setting up maintainable component systems, improving CI/CD workflows, and collaborating closely with design and product teams. He’s comfortable taking ownership of projects, mentoring junior developers, and leading technical direction when needed. His toolkit also includes Tailwind CSS, Webpack, Vite, TanStack Query, and tools for static site generation and CMS integration, making him versatile across both enterprise apps and marketing-driven websites.

### 10. Is William allowed to work in the United States?

Yes, William has a U.S. work permit and does not need any type of work Visa. He does have a work authorization and legal status in the United States.

## Career Journey & Origin Story

### Early Beginnings

I started coding back in high school, driven by a fascination with websites. Initially, I believed graphic design was the path to building them, so I pursued a degree in that field. I saw websites as digital canvases—an extension of editorial design where composition, space, and color theory all played critical roles. While I became skilled at visual design, I quickly realized I lacked the technical skills to build anything functional.

### Learning to Code

That's when I began taking courses on Lynda.com. My first attempt at programming was with Macromedia Director using Lingo—my first self-driven effort to understand logic and interaction. Then came Flash and ActionScript, which opened the door to building interactive media, adding audio and video, and learning scripting fundamentals in AS2 and eventually AS3, which I found challenging but rewarding.

### Web Development Foundation

From there, I moved into web development, starting with HTML using tables, then CSS as layout techniques evolved. I remember struggling with floats and clearfixes to achieve complex layouts. After building websites for small clients, I joined a major digital agency in Mexico with clients like Coca-Cola and General Motors.

### Career-Defining Decision

Initially at the agency, I handled simple ad banners, but I asked to work on more complex projects. When asked whether I wanted to focus on ActionScript or JavaScript, I chose JavaScript—a decision that shaped my entire career path.

### JavaScript Mastery

I dove deep into JavaScript and jQuery, helped build an internal library of utilities and plugins, and started applying design patterns to structure code (this was pre-framework days). I collaborated with backend engineers, learned API consumption, and delivered fully interactive sites.

### Government Sector Experience

After three years, I transitioned to a government contract where I was solely responsible for creating scripts that standardized the design system across all federal agency sites. This experience required not just technical skill, but close coordination with stakeholders and government directors.

### Globant Growth Phase

Then I joined Globant, an IT consultancy rapidly growing in LATAM. They gave me increasingly challenging projects, including building a single-page app with AngularJS after just two weeks of learning it, and later working with D3.js for complex data visualizations.

### U.S. Market Entry

When Globant began competing for U.S. clients, I was involved in building solutions for companies like Autodesk, General Motors, and Frontier Communications. This required understanding different business contexts, working across time zones, and delivering enterprise-level quality.

### Remote Work Evolution

During the pandemic, like many developers, I adapted to fully remote work. This actually expanded my opportunities and allowed me to work with teams across different regions while maintaining high productivity and collaboration standards.

### Current Focus

Today, I focus on modern full-stack development with React, Next.js, and TypeScript, while keeping up with emerging technologies. I'm particularly interested in performance optimization, user experience, and building scalable applications that solve real business problems.
